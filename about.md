I am not a professional developer but just someone interested in these matters. I have followed some online tutorials about various programming topics including
* HTML, CSS
* Sass
* Javascript
* SQL
* Java
* Java - Android
* Python

I was able to contribute some code to MMEX general reports and the android app.

I will use this site as a landing page for future projects and just for general testing purposes.

### Tutorial sites I've Used
* [Codecademy](https://www.Codecademy.com)
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
* [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/)
