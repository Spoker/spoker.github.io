I'm spoker. I am not a professional developer but just someone interested in taking up programming. I've followed a numer of online coures on [Codecademy](http://www.Codecademy.com) and [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) on programming languages such as:
* HTML
* CSS
* Sass
* Javascript
* SQL
* Java
* Java - Android
* Python
* Git

Of course I also followed along with [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/).

I used the stuff I learned mostly for personal use, although I was able to contribute a litte to Open Source projects such as a custom report for [MMEX](https://github.com/moneymanagerex/) and also some small improvements in the Android app.

This site is primarily to test other things out, such as Jekyll right now.
